Implementing MSCI USA Momentum strategy using Python

To address the implementation of the MSCI USA Momentum strategy for the Indian stock market, several key steps were undertaken. First, a relevant universe of stocks was selected by utilizing the Nifty 50 index constituents, representing a diversified and liquid sample of large-cap stocks in India. Historical price data was retrieved using yfinance for these stocks within a specified time frame. Percentage returns were calculated over 6-month and 12-month periods, excluding the most recent month to avoid bias in momentum assessments.

Next, risk-adjusted momentum values were derived by computing the standard deviation of weekly returns over a longer period, typically 3 years, to gauge volatility and risk. Price momentum was then normalized by dividing the calculated momentum by the standard deviation, adjusting for risk. The momentum score was computed by combining 6-month and 12-month risk-adjusted momentums with equal weightage (50% each) to assess the strength and direction of recent price trends. Stocks were selected based on their momentum scores, prioritizing those with the highest scores for potential inclusion in the momentum strategy.

In terms of portfolio construction, market capitalization data was integrated to determine the relative size of selected stocks. The Momentum Weight for each stock was calculated as the product of its momentum score and market capitalization weight. These weights were normalized to ensure they collectively summed up to 100%, facilitating effective portfolio allocation. If multiple securities have the same unwinsorized Momentum Z-score, then the security having a higher weight in the Parent Index is given a higher rank. A fixed number of securities with the highest positive Momentum Z-scores are predetermined for every MSCI Momentum Index at initial construction with an aim to attain a high exposure to the Momentum factor while maintaining sufficient index market capitalization and amount of securities coverage. This is achieved in the next section.Assumptions were made regarding the reliability of historical price performance as an indicator of future momentum and the significance of combining multiple momentum metrics to enhance the robustness of the strategy. Adjustments and refinements can be made based on specific investment objectives and market conditions to optimize the strategy's effectiveness and performance in the Indian stock market.

Maintaining the Index

The following code defines functions to compute the annualized volatility of a specified index over a trailing 3-month period (compute_annualized_volatility) and to calculate the monthly change in volatility (compute_monthly_volatility_change).
The trigger_adhoc_rebalancing function utilizes these functions to determine if ad-hoc rebalancing should be triggered based on the computed monthly change in volatility compared to a specified threshold.
The example usage demonstrates how to apply this logic using the S&P 500 Index (^GSPC) as the reference index and a predefined threshold value (0.05). The function checks if ad-hoc rebalancing should be triggered based on recent volatility changes in the index.
This code snippet provides a framework for implementing the ad-hoc rebalancing trigger based on volatility criteria, incorporating the computation of volatility metrics and threshold comparisons to determine when rebalancing actions should be taken for MSCI Momentum Indexes. Adjustments can be made to customize the index ticker, date parameters, and threshold values according to specific requirements and market conditions.
